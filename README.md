# Global Education Analysis
The Data is hosted by the World bank on Global education. We mainly used two set of datasets namely 'EdStatsCountry' and 'EdStatsData'  <br>
The DataSet has over 3,500 internationally comparable indicators that describe 
education access, progression, completion, literacy, teachers, facilities, population, and expenditure

In this notebook, we analyze the education quality factors as GDP, Government Expenditure on education, Continents, Enrollment ratio.</br>
The quality of education can be measured by the OECD Program for International Student Assessment (or PISA) as well as equality of education.</br>
The data is stored from 1970 to the present also few predicted values are kept in the dataset up to 2100 and more the 200 countries have participated in it </br>

Our basic objective is to understand the data and extract some meaningful information out of it.
so we postulate few assumptions and check where they are useful features or not

Objectives
1. Correlation between Expenditure on education as % of total government expenditure (%) and youth/adult literacy rate for countries with similar GDP per capita PPP
2. How does India compare to its neighboring countries or countries with similar GDP in its literacy rate
3. Variation in performance of Females and Males in PISA and TIMSS across years - for PISA - from 2000 to 2015; for TIMSS take 1995 - 2015 - consider only participating countries; data not available for all countries
4. Enrollment rate vs Completion rate across different countries - which countries are similar?
5. Relationship between internet users and literacy rate.
